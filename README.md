# Hi there, I'm Naveen Hemanth Kokkonda 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology, graduating in June 2026. I specialize in building AI-integrated full-stack applications that solve real-world problems. My projects have reached 100+ users with 85% accuracy rates, focusing on practical tools that make complex tasks simpler.

I enjoy combining modern web technologies with AI to create applications that genuinely help people—from simplifying legal documents to organizing handwritten notes. Currently seeking software engineering opportunities starting June 2026.

## 💡 Fun Fact

I believe the best code is the one that solves real problems. Every project I build starts with a simple question: "How can this make someone's day easier?" Whether it's helping students organize their notes or making legal documents more accessible, I focus on creating tools that genuinely matter to users.
